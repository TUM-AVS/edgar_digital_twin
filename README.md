# TUM EDGAR: Digital Twin

Welcome to the TUM EDGAR Digital Twin repository of the Technical University of Munich! Here you find data, parameters, and information related to our [TUM EDGAR research vehicle](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.15492.pdf)

## What is a Digital Twin?

A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical object or system. In the case of our repository, the digital twin serves as a digital counterpart of our autonomous research vehicle. It captures the vehicle's dynamic behavior, performance, and characteristics in a virtual environment. With this information you can simulate the TUM EDGAR autonomous vehicle in various 2D and 3D simulation environments like Carla.

<summary> <h2> üìÅ Repository content and folder structure </h2> </summary>

This repository is organized into the two sections of `source` and `tools`.

* `source` contains all models and parameters of the vehicle.

*  `tools` contains tools to integrate the digital twin in dedicated development and simulation environments.

## 3D Models

Here, we provide a 3D model for the autonomous research vehicle body. This model can be integrated into 3D simulations, allowing you to visualize the vehicle and its sensors.
The 3D model files can be found in the folder `3d_model`. We offer a `high_res` 3D model (high resolution models for high fidelity simulation environments) and a `low_res` 3D model (downsampled visual 3D model) for various use cases. See the READMEs in the folders for more details.

## Sensor position parameters

Here, we provide a detailed parameter set that specifies the position (x, y, z) of the sensors in relation to the rear axle (base link) of the autonomous research vehicle.
The `x`, `y`, and `z` values represent the coordinates in meters, indicating the displacement of each sensor from base link along the respective axes.
The parameter set can be found in the file [edgar.urdf](source/sensor_parameter/edgar.urdf) located in the `sensor_parameter` directory. We refer to the [README](source/sensor_parameter/README.md) for further details.


## Vehicle dynamics parameters

Here, we provide a list of parameters that define the vehicle dynamics of our autonomous research vehicle. These parameters can be utilized in various vehicle dynamic models, enabling accurate simulation and analysis of the vehicle's behavior.
The parameter set can be found in the file [vehicle_parameters_edgar.yaml](source/vehicle_dynamics_parameter/vehicle_parameters_edgar.yaml) file located in the `vehicle_dynamics_parameter` directory. Each parameter is listed with its corresponding value and its unit.
